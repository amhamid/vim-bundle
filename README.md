vim-bundle
==========

This is just a collection of Vim bundles that are available publicly, such as vim-rails, vim-snipmate, etc.
I put it in github mainly so that whenever I have a new computer, I can just clone this project and my Vim and its bundles will work like a charm.

 Disclaimer 
===========
The bundles in this repository are not made by me, they are available publicly.

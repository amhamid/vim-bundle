vim-bundle
==========
This is just a collection of Vim bundles that are available publicly, such as vim-rails, vim-snipmate, etc.
I put it in github mainly so that whenever I have a new computer, I can just clone this project and my Vim and its bundles will work like a charm.

Installation
============
1. Install Pathogen from Tim Pope. This vim plugin will make sure that all bundles in directory ~/.vim/bundle will be loaded automatically to Vim runtime.
2. Add this at the beginning of your ~/.vimrc: execute pathogen#infect()
3. Clone this repository and copy bundles that you like and put them in the ~/.vim/bundle, e.g. vim-snipmate.

Disclaimer 
==========
The bundles in this repository are not made by me, they are available publicly.
